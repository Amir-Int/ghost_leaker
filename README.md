# info-leaking-ghost

This educational project attempts to create a simple client-server pair in which the client, or malware, running on the victim's machine, sends some information from the victim's system to the server.

## Phases:
### 1. simple-connection-setup:
Simply sets up the connection between the malware and the server
### 2. immediate-transmit:
The malware sends information as soon as it connects to the server.
### 3. interactive:
The malware waits for orders from the server and acts accordingly.
